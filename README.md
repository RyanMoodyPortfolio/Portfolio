During the 1980s and 1990s, “Choose Your Own Adventure” (CYOA) books were very popular. Unlike traditional books which are linearly read from start to finish, CYOA books allow you to decide how the story progresses by reading pages in a non-consecutive order. An example of a page from a CYOA book is shown below:

_You are lost in a jungle, it is starting to get dark, and you need to find shelter. You see a clearing in the forest, a nearby stream and a tall, old tree._

_If you decide to:_
* _Enter the forest clearing, turn to page 12_
* _Follow the stream, turn to page 85_
* _Climb the tree, turn to page 27_

This project aims to create a GUI that can be used to read a CYOA book. This will involve:
*	Designing a model for a CYOA book which can be easily processed by a GUI.
*	Implementing the GUI which allows the user to read these models of CYOA books.
*	Confirming that the GUI functions as required through test cases.
*	Exploring the flexibility of the GUI and how it could be applied to real scenarios.
